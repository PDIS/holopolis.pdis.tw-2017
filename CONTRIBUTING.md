# How to Contribute

Hey there! Glad that you're interested in contributing! We really
appreciate it. :tada:

We know that skills and expertise can vary greatly, so we organize this
resource by the type of contributor you are. Please **follow the path that
best describes you**:

* [I'm moderately technical, and interested in working openly on
  GitHub.][audience-technical]
* [I don't have time to learn GitHub, but would love for someone to help me
  make a change.][audience-no-github]

## Contributing via GitHub

### Background

For a quick summary of technologies used, see the [README][tech-used].

Here are the quick and dirty details that you should know about how we
work.

* For managing events, edit this file:
  [`_data/events.yml`](_data/events.yml)
* We share push access liberally. (Just [open an issue][new-issue] and ask!)
* `master` branch is automatically deployed to our live website.
* `master` branch is protected, and so can't be pushed to directly.
* All changes are made through pull requests.

### Step-by-Step

Here are the general steps that we recommend you follow to get your
improvements onto the website:

1. **Before doing any work, open a new issue** to discuss your idea.
   This helps ensure that our visions align. We'd hate for you to do
   work that we then couldn't merge!
2. Ask for push access. (We'll give it to you!)
    * We use branch protection on `master`, so you can't push there.
3. **Create a "topic branch"** in the main repo, describing your change. eg.
   `my-special-feature`.
4. Make some commits.
5. As early as you'd like, **create a "pull request"** for your branch into
   `master`.
    * If your branch is in the main repo, you'll notice that a review app
      will deployed with your code, and linked in the issue. This will
      help us collaborate more smoothly.
6. When you think your changes are ready, post a pull request comment to
   say so, and **ask for a review**.
7. **We'll review your changes** with the help of the Review App. Then we'll either:
    1. merge them right away, or
    2. ask you to make some changes.
        - Don't worry! This is totally no big deal! Working together to get
          things just right is a common dynamic in contributing to projects.
          We'll work on it together.
8. After coming to agreement on the best possible contribution, **we'll
   merge your changes** into `master`!
9. Your changes are now live on the website. Yay! Thanks a bunch!

## Contributing without GitHub

We totally get it: GitHub can be intimidating, and there's not always time to
learn :slightly_smiling_face:
